## Project Motivation and Overview<a name="motivation"></a>

### This repository documents a data science project.
### We analyze a credit card customer dataset and build models to answer the following questions:

(1). **Customer Churn Prediction**, can we predict which customers will stop using our product in the future?

(2). **Customer Segmentation**, is there a clustering structure in the dataset?

(3).  **Customer Lifetime Value**, how to better estimate each customer's lifetime value?

# Customer-Data-Analysis

This is an on-going data science project. We analyze and model a credit card customer dataset to explore the following questions:

(1). What are the top key factors that affect customer churn rate?

(2). What is the overall financial health status of our customers?

(3). Is there a clustering structure in the data, i.e. customer segmentation?

(4). What is the larger source of income, interest or transaction fee?

# Customer-Data-Analysis

### This is an on-going data science project. We analyze and model a credit card customer dataset to explore the following questions:

(1). What are the top key factors that affect **Customer Churn Rate**?

(2). What is the overall **Financial Health Status** of our customers?

(3). Is there a clustering structure in the data, i.e. **Customer Segmentation**?

(4). What is the larger **Source of Income**, interest or transaction fee, according to this dataset?

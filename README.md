# Customer-Data-Analysis

### This is an on-going data science project. We analyze and model a credit card customer dataset to explore the following questions:

(1). **Customer Churn Rate**, what are the top key affecting factors?

(2). What is the overall **Financial Health Status** of our customers?

(3). **Customer Segmentation**, is there a clustering structure in the data?

(4). **Source of Revenue**, Which part is larger, interest or transaction fee?

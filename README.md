# Customer-Data-Analysis

### This repository documents a data science project. 
### We analyze and model a credit card customer dataset to explore the following questions:

(1). **Customer Churn Rate**, what are the top key affecting factors ?

(2). **Customer Lifetime Value** estimate ?

(3). **Customer Segmentation**, is there a clustering structure in the data ?

(4). **Source of Revenue**, which part is larger, interest or transaction fee ?

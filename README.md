## Motivation and Overview<a name="motivation"></a>

### Understanding your customers is the key to successful business decision making.
### In this project, we analyze and model a credit card customer dataset to explore the following questions:

(1). **Customer Churn Prediction**, can we predict which customers will stop using our product in the future?

(2). **Customer Segmentation**, is there a clustering structure in the dataset?

(3).  **Customer Lifetime Value**, how to better estimate each customer's lifetime value?
